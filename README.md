# Noise
 
A multi-page application in a more active-learning format that explores the difference between signals and nose, and introduces signal averaging, moving average filters, and Savitzky-Golay filters as computational approaches for improving the signal-to-noise ratio. The application uses a database that contains 64 visible spectra of a blue dye.

To run locally, install the package Shiny (if not already installed), and enter the following two lines into the console:

library(shiny)

shiny::runGitHub("Noise","dtharvey")
